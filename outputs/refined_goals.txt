Below is an analysis of the initial goal and a refined list of requirements that can help guide the development process.

──────────────────────────────
1. Analysis of the Initial Goal

• Original Statement:
  "Code a simple ToDo-List in Python. It should have a graphical user interface."

• Observations:
  - The scope is rather vague. It doesn’t state what features (beyond simply “ToDo-List”) are needed.
  - It doesn’t specify what constitutes “simple.” Could be adding tasks, editing them, marking them as complete, etc.
  - The type of GUI isn’t specified (e.g., using Tkinter, PyQt, or another framework).
  - There is no mention of non-functional requirements such as usability, performance, or maintainability.

2. Refinement of the Requirements

Based on these points, a more complete and structured set of requirements might include:

A. Functional Requirements

 1. Add New Tasks:
  – The user can add a new task by entering the task description.
  – (Optional) Allow additional properties like due date, priority, or category if desired.

 2. Display the Task List:
  – The application shall display all tasks in a clear list format.
  – Tasks should be visually differentiated based on status (e.g., pending, completed).

 3. Modify Tasks:
  – The user can mark a task as complete.
  – The user can edit the description (and other properties, if available) of an existing task.

 4. Delete Tasks:
  – The user can remove a task from the list.

 5. Persist Data:
  – Tasks should be saved locally so that the list is retained between sessions.
  – (Optional) Consider simple file storage (e.g., JSON) or a lightweight database.

B. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Requirements

 1. General Appearance:
  – The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.
  – The design should cater to common usability principles (e.g., simple navigation, clear labels).

 2. Interaction Elements:
  – Buttons for adding, editing, marking complete, and deleting tasks.
  – A text entry field for task descriptions (and possibly other details).
  – A list or table widget to display tasks.

 3. Platform and Libraries:
  – The application should be built using Python.
  – The choice of GUI toolkit (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, etc.) should be justified based on ease of use, community support, and platform compatibility.
  – The look and feel should be consistent across supported platforms.

C. Non-functional Requirements

 1. Simplicity:
  – The application is intended to be “simple,” meaning that it should be lightweight and easy to understand both for users and developers.

 2. Usability:
  – The GUI must be accessible for users with basic computer skills.
  – Any text and controls should be clearly labeled.

 3. Portability:
  – The application should run on common operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

 4. Maintainability:
  – The code should be modular and well-documented to facilitate future enhancements.

D. Constraints and Future Considerations

 1. Scope:
  – Initially, focus on key features for task management. Future enhancements (like task categorization, filtering, or priority sorting) should be identified as extensions.

 2. Performance:
  – Given the application’s simplicity, performance is unlikely to be a concern, but ensure that data persistence (if it grows) remains responsive.

3. Final Refined Goal Statement

"Develop a simple, user-friendly ToDo-List application in Python with a graphical user interface. The application shall allow users to add, view, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks. It should save the task list locally between sessions and provide an intuitive layout using a suitable Python GUI framework (e.g., Tkinter or PyQt). The design should focus on ease of use, portability across major operating systems, and maintainable code architecture while allowing scope for future feature enhancements."

This refined definition should serve as a more actionable and testable specification for the software development process.
