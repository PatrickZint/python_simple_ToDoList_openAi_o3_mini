# **High-Level System Architecture for Simple Calculator Application**

## **1. Introduction**

This document presents the high-level system architecture for the **Simple Calculator** application as detailed in the provided System Specifications. The architecture outlines the primary components, their interactions, and the selected technology stack to ensure the application is robust, maintainable, and scalable.

## **2. Architectural Overview**

The Simple Calculator adheres to the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern, promoting separation of concerns and enhancing maintainability. The MVC structure divides the application into three interconnected components:

- **Model:** Manages the core arithmetic logic and data handling.
- **View:** Handles the graphical user interface (GUI) presentation.
- **Controller:** Facilitates communication between the Model and View, managing user inputs and application flow.

## **5. System Architecture Diagram**

Since visual diagrams cannot be rendered in this text format, the system architecture can be conceptually understood as follows:

1. **User Interaction:**
   - Users interact with the **View** (GUI) via mouse clicks or keyboard inputs.
   
2. **Controller Processing:**
   - The **Controller** captures these inputs through the **InputHandler**.
   - **InputHandler** interprets the inputs and delegates actions to the **OperationHandler** or **ErrorHandler** as needed.

3. **Model Operations:**
   - The **OperationHandler** invokes methods from the **Model** (e.g., **CalculatorEngine**) to perform arithmetic calculations.
   - The **CalculatorEngine** processes the operations and returns results or errors.

4. **View Update:**
   - The **Controller** receives the results and updates the **View** (e.g., **DisplayScreen**) accordingly.
   - In case of errors, the **ErrorHandler** ensures that appropriate messages are displayed without disrupting the application flow.

5. **Additional Features:**
   - **MemoryManager** and **HistoryManager** handle memory functions and calculation history, interacting with both **Model** and **View** as necessary.
   - **ThemeManager** allows dynamic theming, updating the **View** based on user preferences.

## **6. Data Flow**

The data flow within the system follows a unidirectional path to maintain clarity and reduce complexity:

1. **Input Acquisition:**
   - User inputs are captured by the **View** and passed to the **Controller**.

2. **Processing:**
   - The **Controller** validates and processes inputs, interacting with the **Model** to perform calculations.

3. **Output Rendering:**
   - Results or error messages are sent back to the **View** for display to the user.

4. **Optional Data Handling:**
   - For memory and history features, the **Model** manages data persistence, while the **View** presents this data as needed.
