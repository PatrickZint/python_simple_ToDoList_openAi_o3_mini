Below is a complete specification document that details functional requirements, non‐functional requirements, and system design recommendations for the ToDo-List application as refined. This document is intended to guide development, testing, and future enhancements.

────────────────────────────
1. Functional Requirements

A. Task Management

1. Create/New Task  
 • The system shall provide an input field for users to enter a task description.  
 • Optionally, the system may allow users to enter additional properties such as due date, priority, or category.  
 • Upon submission (e.g., clicking an “Add Task” button), the task is added to the task list with a default “pending” status.

2. Display Tasks  
 • The application shall display all tasks in a clear, scrollable list.  
 • Each task entry should show, at minimum, a description and its status (pending or completed).  
 • Tasks shall be visually differentiated by status. For example, completed tasks may have strikethrough text or a different background color.

3. Update Tasks  
 • The system shall let users mark a task as complete, which updates its status immediately in the UI.  
 • Users shall be able to edit an existing task’s description and properties. When the user submits an edit, the modified task is saved.

4. Delete Tasks  
 • The system shall provide a way (e.g., a “Delete” button) for users to remove a task from the list permanently.

B. Data Persistence

1. Local Storage  
 • The application shall persist tasks locally so that task data remains available between sessions.  
 • A JSON file (or similarly simple file structure) will be used for task storage.  
 • All changes (adding, modifying, deleting tasks) should trigger an update of the stored file.

2. Data Integrity and Backup  
 • The system should verify that data is correctly loaded at startup.  
 • In case of read/write errors, a basic rollback or alert mechanism should notify the user (or at least log the error for developer debugging).

C. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

1. General Layout and Appearance  
 • The GUI shall be intuitive, clean, and user-friendly.  
 • Common usability practices (such as clear labels, consistent placement of controls, and responsive feedback) must be followed.

2. Interaction Elements  
 • A text entry field for new tasks.  
 • Clearly labeled buttons for Add, Edit, Mark Complete, and Delete operations.  
 • A list (ListBox or Table widget, depending on chosen framework capabilities) to display tasks with dynamic visual differentiation based on task status.

3. Platform Consistency  
 • The look and feel of the GUI must be consistent and tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. Non-functional Requirements

A. Simplicity and Usability  
 • The application shall be lightweight and easy for both users and developers to understand and navigate.  
 • All controls and labels should use clear, simple language suitable for users with basic computer skills.

B. Performance  
 • UI interactions (e.g., adding or updating a task) must update within 100ms under normal usage conditions.  
 • Heavy processing (if needed for future enhancements) should be offloaded to avoid blocking the main UI thread.

C. Portability  
 • The application will run on the major desktop operating systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
 • The development should target Python version 3.8 (or later) and use libraries that are cross-platform (e.g., Tkinter).

D. Maintainability  
 • Code shall be organized in a modular and well-documented structure.  
 • Follow standard coding practices with inline comments and external documentation to facilitate future enhancements and debugging.

E. Security  
 • Even though the application is desktop-based and uses local storage, secure coding best practices must be applied (e.g., input validation, proper error handling).  
 • Sensitive data (if incorporated later, such as user credentials or encrypted notes) should be stored using industry-standard encryption methods (e.g., AES-256 for stored data).  
 • If the application supports user authentication in the future, communications should use TLS 1.2+ for any network exchanges, and role-based access should be implemented.

F. Testability and Documentation  
 • Automated unit tests must be developed for each core functionality (task creation, modification, deletion, persistence).  
 • Performance tests should be coordinated with UI tests to confirm response times remain under 100ms.  
 • Security audits or code reviews should be scheduled at regular intervals to ensure compliance with secure coding guidelines.

3. System Design Recommendations

A. Architectural Design

1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern  
 • Use the MVC pattern to separate concerns:
  – Model: Responsible for task data representation and persistence (e.g., objects for tasks, a data storage module interacting with the JSON file).  
  – View: Encapsulates all Tkinter (or other GUI framework) components, handling the user interface and layout.  
  – Controller: Manages user input, ties the Model and View together by handling button clicks, form submissions, and updating the view based on model changes.

2. Modular Design  
 • Separate code into distinct modules:
  – A module for task management (business logic)  
  – A module dealing with file I/O for persistence  
  – A dedicated module for the GUI elements and event handling  
 • This approach supports easier testing, maintenance, and extension.

B. Data Persistence  
 • Use the built-in Python JSON library to read/write tasks to a local file.  
 • Consider implementing a FileManager class to encapsulate all persistence logic (i.e., load_data, save_data).  
 • Ensure that file operations are atomic or properly backed up to handle unexpected shutdowns or I/O errors.

C. Responsiveness and Concurrency  
 • Given that Tkinter runs on a single thread for GUI updates, ensure that any long-running operations (if they are added later) are executed in background threads (using Python’s threading or multiprocessing modules) to avoid freezing the UI.

D. Deployment and Environment  
 • The application will be developed in Python (v3.8 or later) and will primarily use Tkinter for GUI development.  
 • Dependency management should be handled via a requirements.txt file or a Pipfile, ensuring that all required packages have known, secure versions.  
 • Code signing and versioning practices should be adopted especially if the application is distributed to end-users.

E. Future-Proofing and Extensibility  
 • Design the codebase to allow for future enhancements such as:
  – Task categorization, filtering, or sorting by priority/due date  
  – Integration with online storage or synchronization with a cloud service  
  – User authentication for multi-user environments  
 • Maintain a well-documented API between modules so that new features can be added with minimal modifications to the core architecture.

F. Testing and Quality Assurance  
 • Implement unit tests for each module and integration tests for complete workflows (e.g., adding, modifying, deleting tasks).  
 • Use continuous integration (CI) tools to automatically run tests on every change, ensuring that performance benchmarks and security best practices are continuously met.  
 • Include logging of key actions (e.g., data writes, errors during UI events) for debugging and monitoring purposes.

4. Summary

Final Goal Statement:  
Develop a simple, user-friendly ToDo-List desktop application in Python with a graphical user interface built using Tkinter. The application shall allow users to add, view, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks while consistently saving the task list locally between sessions. The design focuses on an intuitive layout, cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, and Linux), and a modular, maintainable codebase that scales for future enhancements. Additional measurable targets include ensuring typical GUI response times under 100ms and adherence to secure coding practices.

By following these detailed specifications and design recommendations, the development process will address both functionality and quality attributes while providing a clear roadmap for current and future work.
